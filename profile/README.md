# Ingridentify

Ingridentify is a project aimed at addressing prevalent challenges in modern meal planning, unhealthy eating habits, and food wastage. Our solution utilizes computer vision and AI to create a user-friendly application that recognizes various fruits and vegetables through image scanning.

## Problem Statement

In the fast-paced lifestyle, individuals often face limited time to make nutritious meal choices and lack familiarity with diverse ingredients. This leads to repetitive, uninspiring menus, and discarded, unused produce. The overconsumption of processed foods and the underutilization of fresh, plant-based ingredients further compound these issues.

## Solution

Our application leverages artificial intelligence and computer vision to recognize different fruits and vegetables. It provides users with personalized menu suggestions based on their pantry items and offers step-by-step cooking recipes. By doing so, we aim to alleviate the struggles of meal planning, promote healthier eating habits, and reduce food waste.

## Features

- **Ingredient Recognition:** Utilizes computer vision to identify various fruits and vegetables through image scanning.
- **Personalized Menu Suggestions:** Offers users personalized menu suggestions based on their pantry items.
- **Detailed Cooking Recipes:** Provides step-by-step cooking recipes for a diverse culinary experience.

## Goals

Our primary goal is to create an intuitive plant/fruit scanning application that promotes healthier eating habits and reduces food waste. We aim to empower individuals to make informed food choices, diversify their menus, and contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle.
